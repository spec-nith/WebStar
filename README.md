        difficulty level, with **Level 1** being the **least 
        difficult**, and **Level 5** being the **most challenging**.

    ```Closes #<issue-no>``` to mark your contribution as valid.

        following command:-

        git add -A
        git commit -m "commit message"
        git push -u origin <branch-name>
