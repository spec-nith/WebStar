					<h1>Arduino For IOT </h1>
					<p>HOLA NITIANS!ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

					<p>In the midst of a monotonous journey of online classes, when an arduino board hits up the zeal to learn, the result is a  whacking participation of students. This was a compact elucidation of Workshop conducted by the Society for Promotion of Electronics Culture (SPEC) for the freshers. 

						Spec conducted a workshop on Arduino for IoT which witnessed 400+ registrations on December 24, 2020. The workshop was filled with enthusiasm of the freshmen and the excitement to learn and grow. Spec provided a hands-on experience with the projects and simulations and got various students interested in microcontrollers and Iot. 
						The freshmen were made aware of every component.
						
						From basics of night light demonstration, blinking, servo and ultrasonic sensors students created a hands-on automatic hand sanitiser. The session was followed by a quiz based on the workshop and the winners are to be awarded in the SPEC Fest.
						
						It was  exciting to witness the level of interaction of the students. Their queries were answered efficiently.  Hence, with the proper management, support and collaboration of the team, the workshop was wrapped up in three hours, ending on an informative and refreshing note.</p><br>

					<h1>School Webinar</h1>
					<p>HOLA NITIANS!ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

					<p>â€œStart where you're, Use what you have, Do what you can."&#39;With a similar maxim, a school webinar was coordinated by Team SPEC (Society for Promotion of Electronics Culture)

					 on November 7 and November 8, 2020. The meeting was coordinated to edify the sprouting minds of the country with the impending tech and almost 100+ understudies of St.Luke's senior auxiliary School, Solan, Sacred heart Senior Secondary school, Dharamshala and Parmarth International School, Hamirpur Participated enthusiastically.This session began by presenting the students with the blasting universe of the most recent advancements like AI, ML Web Development, App Development, AR, VR and Cryptography by taking real time models. 
					 With an objective of evoking an eagerness in the impressionistic mind of the young blood we assisted them in realising their maximum efforts so that they can put forth this realisation to bring the technological revolution.
					  
					 To make the meeting more intuitive, the group additionally introduced some snappy clips over different projects they made, similar to insect bot, hand motion controlled versatile seat, AR applications, and so on.The meeting finished with the Q&A meeting in which a few students shared extraordinary thoughts which were valued by the group, and they were urged to seek after those thoughts. </p><br>

															<h1>C Programming Workshop</h1>
															<p>Greetings everyone, <span>Team Spec</span> is presenting a workshop on <span>C - A platform to learn and built your logics.</span><br>
																Although numerous computer languages are used for writing computer applications, the computer programming language, C, is the most popular language worldwide. Everything from microcontrollers to operating systems is written in C since itâ€™s very flexible and versatile, allowing maximum control with minimal commands.
																If you are interested in a career in computer programming, it would be wise to start by learning the C as your first programming language.<br>
																It will help build your logic development, understand concept of data structures, pointers, loops etc. Once learnt, C acts as a base from which you can move
																onto other programminglanguages.
																<ul>
																	<li>Header Files, Identifiers, Constants, Data Types</li>
																	<li>Operators, Types of Conversions</li>
																	<li>Conditional Statements and Loops</li>
																	<li>Arrays, Functions, Recursion</li>
