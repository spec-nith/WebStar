				<p><br>We all love space . Any day when a rocket is launched it just steals all the attention away. So why can’t we just fill fuel in our rocket and explore other solar systems. The reason why not is because rockets provide a lot of force with less efficiency and in less time. They are good to escape the gravity of earth but not in space. You would require a lot of time to reach other solar systems. So, what’s the solution that we have Ion thruster engines.</p>

				<p><strong>What is it then?</strong></p>
				<p>Ion thruster engines are just the opposite of the chemical engines that we see. Ion thruster provide very little force, with high efficiency and for months of time. In the gravity of earth it will not be able to provide enough thrust to get itself out of gravity of earth but when there is no external force it is the best. As the drop by drop equivalent force just makes up a very large net force at the end. It is considered to be 20 time more efficient that chemical thrusters.</p>

				<p><strong>So how does it work?</strong></p>
				<p>An ion thruster ionizes  propellant by adding or removing electrons to produce ions. Most thrusters ionize propellant by electron bombardment: a high-energy electron (negative charge) collides with a propellant atom (neutral charge), releasing electrons from the propellant atom and resulting in a positively charged ion. The  gas  produced  consists  of positive ions and negative electrons in proportions that result in no over-all electric charge. This is called a plasma. Plasma has some of the properties of a gas, but it is affected by electric and magnetic fields. Common examples are lightning and the substance inside fluorescent light bulbs.</p>

				<p>The most common propellant used in ion propulsion is xenon, which is easily ionized and has a high atomic mass, thus generating a desirable level of thrust when ions are accelerated. It also is inert and has a high storage density; therefore, it is well suited for storing on spacecraft. In most ion thrusters, electrons are generated with the discharge hollow cathode by a process called thermionic emission. </p>

				<p>Electrons produced by the discharge cathode are attracted to the dis- charge chamber walls, which are charged to a high positive potential by the voltage applied by the thruster’s discharge power supply. Neutral propellant is injected into the discharge chamber, where the electrons bombard the propellant to produce positively charged ions and release more electrons. High-strength magnets prevent electrons from freely reaching the discharge channel walls. This lengthens the time that electrons reside in the discharge chamber and increases the probability of an ionizing event.</p>

				<p>The positively charged ions migrate toward grids that contain thousands of very precisely aligned holes (apertures) at the aft end of the ion thruster. The first grid is the positively charged electrode (screen grid). A very high positive voltage is applied to the screen grid, but it is configured to force the discharge plasma to reside at a high voltage. As ions pass between the grids, they are accelerated toward a negatively charged electrode (the accelerator grid) to very high speeds (up to 90,000 mph).</p>

				<p>The positively charged ions are accelerated out of the thruster as an ion beam, which produces thrust. The neutralizer, another hollow cathode, expels an equal amount of electrons to make the total charge of the exhaust beam neutral. Without a neutralizer, the spacecraft would build up a negative charge and eventually ions would be drawn back to the spacecraft, reducing thrust and causing spacecraft erosion.</p>

				<p>The primary parts of an ion propulsion system are the ion thruster, power processing unit (PPU),propellant management system (PMS), and digital control and interface unit (DCIU). The PPU converts the electrical power from a power source—usually solar cells or a nuclear heat source—into the voltages needed for the hollow cathodes to operate, to bias the grids,and to provide the currents needed to produce the ion beam. The PMS may be divided into a high-pressure assembly (HPA) that reduces the xenon pressure from the higher storage pressures in the tank to a level that is then metered with accuracy for the ion thruster components by a low-pressure assembly (LPA). The DCIU controls and monitors system performance,and performs communication functions with the spacecraft computer.</p>

				<p>They have been significant improvements in the field of space research, and this is but one of many. We will see more such new inventions in the future, which will launch us into the golden age of space research</p>
